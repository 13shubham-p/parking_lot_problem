# parking_lot_problem
this repository contains c++ program for the solution of praking lot problem
The proposed solution is written in C++ and C++11 support is required for successful build.

To build exuctable file : 

type make in shell to generate parking_lot executable file
  $ make
this will generate a executable file with name parking_lot

Ways to execute the project:

1-if you run the executable file without any argument
  Eg
     $./parking_lot
 then it will take user input in shell and display corresponding output(used "abort" as key to close the window)

2-else if there is a file name(stored in the same folder) passed as an argument
  Eg
     $./parking_lot file_inputs.txt
then the program will read the text file line by line and display appropriate output
