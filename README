-type make in shell to generate parking_lot executable file
-if you run the executable file without any argument
  Eg
     $./parking_lot
 then it will take user input in shell and display corresponding output
-else if there is a file name(stored in the same folder) passed as an argument
  Eg
     $./parking_lot file_inputs.txt
 then the program will read the text file line by line and display appropriate output
